# Configuring Cronjobs

Cronjobs are scripts that are designed to be called periodically, in Fork CMS they are mainly used to go through queued items like for example queued e-mails. They can be excuted either through commandline as well as over your webserver.

Without additional modules has Fork CMS two cronjobs:

Commandline: 

```
php http://mydomain.com/backend/cronjob.php?module=core&action=process_queued_hooks

php http://mydomain.com/backend/cronjob.php?module=core&action=send_queued_emails
```

Webserver: 

```
/usr/bin/wget -O - --quiet --timeout=1440 "http://mydomain.com/backend/cronjob.php?module=core&action=process_queued_hooks"
/usr/bin/wget -O - --quiet --timeout=1440 "http://mydomain.com/backend/cronjob.php?module=core&action=send_queued_emails"
```
If you provider cannot be of help in setting up a cron job, you can try to use a free service like Easycron.com.

Some additional modules need extra cronjobs, check the details page on your modules overview to see which cronjobs need to be set for the module.

When setting cronjobs on servers with several Fork CMS installation try to spread the execution by changing the minutes parameter.
